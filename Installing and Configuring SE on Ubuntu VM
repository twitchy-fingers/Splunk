Installing and Configuring SE

•	You can install the Splunk Enterprise Debian package only into the default location, /opt/splunk • 	This location must be a regular directory and cannot be a symbolic link.  
•	You must have access to the root user or have sudo permissions to install the package.  
•	The package does not create environment variables to access the Splunk Enterprise installation directory. You must set those variables on your own.  
Note: If you need to install Splunk Enterprise somewhere else, or if you use a symbolic link for /opt/splunk, then use a tar file to install the software.
